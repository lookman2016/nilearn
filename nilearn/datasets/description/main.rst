Montreal Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience conference 2018 datasets


Notes
-----
This functional MRI datasets are used as part of teaching how to use
machine learning to predict age from rs-fmri with Nilearn.

The dataset consists of 50 children (ages 3-13) and 33 young adults (ages
18-39). This rs-fmri data can be used to try to predict who are adults and
who are children.

The data is downsampled to 4mm resolution for convenience. The original
data is downloaded from OpenNeuro.
